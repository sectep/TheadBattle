## Features

- **Multithreading**: Each player operates on its own thread using `Runnable` and `Thread`.  
- **Custom Actions**: Encapsulated methods for attacking, reloading, and processing events.  
- **Processing Simulation**: Simulates computational delays with a processing animation.  
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to extend with additional combat mechanics.

## Project Structure

The project is modularized into different packages:  
- **Combat**: Handles attacking and reloading actions.  
- **Processing**: Manages the processing delay and visual feedback.  
- **MyThread**: Manages the player threads and execution logic.  
- **Main**: Entry point for the application.
